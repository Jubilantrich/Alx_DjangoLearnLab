Steps:
Install Django:

Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Install Django using pip: pip install django.
Create Your Django Project:

Create a new Django project by running: django-admin startproject LibraryProject.
Run the Development Server:

Navigate into your project directory (cd LibraryProject).
Create a README.md file inside the LibraryProject.
Start the development server using: python manage.py runserver.
Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view the default Django welcome page.
Explore the Project Structure:

Familiarize yourself with the created project structure. Pay particular attention to:
settings.py: Configuration for the Django project.
urls.py: The URL declarations for the project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site.
manage.py: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project

# Permissions and Groups in Django

## Custom Permissions
Custom permissions defined in the MyModel class:
- can_view: Can view MyModel instances.
- can_create: Can create MyModel instances.
- can_edit: Can edit MyModel instances.
- can_delete: Can delete MyModel instances.

## Groups and Permissions
- *Viewers*: Assigned can_view permission.
- *Editors*: Assigned can_create and can_edit permissions.
- *Admins*: Assigned all permissions (can_create, can_edit, can_delete, can_view).

## Usage in Views
- Views are secured using the @permission_required decorator.
- Example: 
  ```python
  @permission_required('app_name.can_edit', raise_exception=True)

---

### Deliverables

1. **models.py**: Updated with custom permissions.
2. **views.py**: Views secured with permission_required.
3. **urls.py**: URL patterns for the secured views.
4. *Documentation*: A README.md file explaining permissions and groups setup.

Let me know if you need help with a specific part of the implementation!

# Security Best Practices in Django

## Configurations in settings.py
1. DEBUG = False: Ensures sensitive error messages are not exposed.
2. CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE and SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE: Enforces HTTPS for cookies.
3. SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER: Protects against XSS attacks.
4. X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY': Prevents clickjacking.
5. SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF: Stops browsers from inferring MIME types.

## Content Security Policy (CSP)
Implemented using django-csp middleware to mitigate XSS risks.

## View and Template Security
- All forms include CSRF tokens.
- Views use Django ORM to avoid SQL injection.
- Input is validated using Django forms.

## Testing Notes
- Test for CSRF and XSS by submitting forms with malicious scripts.
- Verify that cookies are sent only over HTTPS.
- Test CSP headers with browser developer tools.
